    A popular means of 
    
    The cost of the resulting algorithm scales linearly with the dimension of the estimands and  does not require the calculation or storage of large covariance matrices.
    %Nor does it require artificial evolution dynamics to be applied to static latent parameters.
    We do not require exact likelihood evaluations of the prior or posterior samples.
    However, we do require the ability to simulate from the prior, and sufficient regularity of the forward operator.
    Our method achieves orders-of-magnitude speed-up over a classical physical model inversion approach for high-dimensional models, while maintaining acceptable accuracy. This increases the dimensionality of the estimand at which inference is feasible, without resorting to dimension reduction methods.
