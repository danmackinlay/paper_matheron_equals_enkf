\section{Conclusion}

\meth{} is an easy-to-implement and flexible method enabling inverse inference with challenging observation models.
Sample-based conditional updates are an under-utilised technique in machine learning.
Although their use in time-series filtering is well-known, their use in inverse problems is less appreciated.
We hypothesise there are more useful techniques to be uncovered here.
Bringing the Machine Learning research on pathwise updates into engagement with the Ensemble method literature suggests improvements to each.
For example, outside the ensemble context, \citet{WilsonPathwise2021} observe that Matheron updates are very general and may be extended from finite vectors to continuous functions spaces, even to processes on smooth manifolds other than \(\mathbb{R}^{D}\) by Karhunen-Lo\`eve expansions. 
As with ensemble  filtering problems, ensemble inversion methods could possibly be accelerated by improved sampling schemes, for example with sigma-point or QMC sampling schemes.
